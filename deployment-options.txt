VLR.gg API - Deployment Options
=================================

For: 2 users (you + friend)
Goal: Cheapest, reliable, fast


OPTION 1: Raspberry Pi + Cloudflare Tunnel (Recommended)
--------------------------------------------------------
Cost: ~$80-85 one-time (pays for itself in ~16 months vs cloud)

Hardware:
  - Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB): ~$55
  - Raspberry Pi 5 (4GB): ~$60 (faster, overkill)
  - SD card + power + case: ~$25

Bandwidth:
  - Each request: ~50-200KB scrape, ~1-10KB response
  - 100 requests/day = ~20MB total
  - Need: 10+ Mbps upload (most home plans have this)

Running multiple services:
  - Pi 4/5 can run 10+ small Node.js APIs
  - Each API uses ~50-150MB RAM
  - Use PM2 or Docker to manage them

Exposing to internet:
  - Cloudflare Tunnel (free, easy, auto SSL)
  - Tailscale (free, but only for devices with Tailscale)
  - Port forwarding (free, need static IP or DDNS)

Pros: One-time cost, no cold starts, full control, can run multiple services
Cons: Relies on home power/internet, initial setup


OPTION 2: Fly.io Free Tier
--------------------------
Cost: $0

What you get:
  - 3 small VMs (shared CPU, 256MB RAM)
  - Always on (no cold starts)
  - Global edge deployment

Setup: Add fly.toml + Dockerfile, deploy via CLI

Pros: Free, reliable, no hardware to manage
Cons: Limited resources, need to stay within free tier


OPTION 3: Render Free Tier
--------------------------
Cost: $0

What you get:
  - 750 hours/month
  - Auto-deploy from GitHub
  - Auto SSL

Catch: Sleeps after 15 min inactivity
  - First request after sleep: 30-50 seconds
  - Then fast until it sleeps again

Pros: Easiest setup, free
Cons: Cold starts are annoying


OPTION 4: Railway
-----------------
Cost: ~$5/month (or free tier with limitations)

What you get:
  - Easy GitHub deploy
  - Redis addon available
  - No cold starts on paid tier

Pros: Very easy, reliable
Cons: Costs money


OPTION 5: VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.)
------------------------------------------
Cost: $4-6/month

What you get:
  - Full Linux server
  - Complete control
  - Can run anything

Setup: Install Node, PM2, Nginx, SSL (certbot)

Pros: Full control, can run multiple services
Cons: More setup, monthly cost


SUMMARY
-------

  - One-time cost
  - Can run all your APIs
  - No cold starts
  - Full control

Runner-up: Fly.io free tier
  - If you don't want hardware
